## passivepraxis: decentralized, online solidarity.

Allow your userbase to quickly opt-in and donate computer time while browsing to a social cause. For now, computer time will be used to mine a cryptocurrency called "Monero" and donated to a social cause.

passivepraxis aims to be an experiment in effective, voluntary, and decentralized altruism.
